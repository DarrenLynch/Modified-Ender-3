## Introduction
In this repo I plan to stor all aspects of my small 3D printer, including hardware and firmware.

The 3D printer is a heavily modified Ender 3 with the key differentiators:

 1. BigTreeTech SKR 2 mainboard with marlin
 2. E3D Hemera direct drive hotend/extruder
 3. An external fillament dispensor for 5kg drums

The original setup was also modified and was put to work on engineering projects doing long prints on ABS fillament where eventually repairing it became too time consuming and a complete rebuild was decided upon. Whilst we upgrade the printer it makes sense to document all aspects for future maintinance and reproduction.
## Firmware
The chose firmware is Marlin 2, with the appropriate modifications to allow the use of the Hemera extruder. There is not an example setup for Marlin using the SKR 2, the closest are the SKR 1.4 for Ender 3, or SKR 1.4 Turbo for the Ender 3 pro. Therefore, I have taken the SKR 1.4 example from Ender 3 and will keep the Firmware in this repo for future use. 
## Hardware
To start I have added an image from the SKR 2 repo, however this will eventually contain manuals of all modified components and also and 3D files for any custom parts.
